# Changelog
## [Unreleased]

## [1.4] - 2023-10-15
### Breaking change
- `jsonb_accessor` dropped support for Ruby 2 and Rails versions lower than 6.1. Support for ActiveRecord::Enum was also
dropped because ActiveRecord 7.1 now requires each enum field to be backed by a database column. Enums will still work
when using AR versions lower than 7.1. This is a limitation of Rails, not of this gem.

### Fixed

- Bug fix: An array of datetimes previously caused an error. https://github.com/madeintandem/jsonb_accessor/pull/169. Thanks @bekicot.
- Rails 7.1 is officially supported and tested against.
